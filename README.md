# travel-music

# Description:
We have made an app which will generate a playlist based on the weather & location of the destination which you are traveling. 
Motivation for development?

We have all been traveling at some point and realized we did not have a playlist prepared for our lengthy flight or drive. This app takes care of the forgetful travelers problem by providing us with a generated music playlist based off of where we are headed. 

# User story:
As a user/traveler I would like an app that would tell me the weather forecast of my destination and provide me with weather/mood related music to listen to on my journey, as well as a visual representation of the weather.


# Frameworks:

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by pureCSS and uses weatherAPI, giphy, and Spotify.
